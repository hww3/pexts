    Multicast UDP Socket Module
    ===========================

This is an implementation of extra functionality needed to
listen to Multicast groups with an UDP socket in Pike. This
is encapsulated as a module calles "Stdio.MultiCastUDP", that
inherits the standard "Stdio.UDP".

This version works with pike 7.0 and pike 7.2

INSTALATION
===========

There is some magin in the makefile that should allow to
just type "make" and then, as root, type "make install".

It it doesn't work, you should verify that the paths in
the file "pike_paths.d" are correct (look at PIKE_CINCLUDES
and PIKE_MODULES).

USAGE
=====

Ths API of Stdio.UDP is extended with the following methods:

void join(string group_ip)

    Joins the multicast group specified by it's IP.

void leave(string group_ip)

    Leaves the multicast group specified by it's IP.

void setLoopback(int flag)

    If flag!=0, then the socket listen to it's own packets.

void setTTL(int ttl)

    Set's the Time To Live of packets to the specified value.

void setInterface(string if_ip)

    Set's the outgoing interface for the packets to the local
    interface that has "if_ip" as it's IP. This is needed if
    you don't have a Multicast default route in your routing
    table, or if you want to override it's value. If you don't
    have a default Multicast route (i.e., 224.0.0.0/8) and
    don't call tis function, the socket will raise an error on
    sending.

EXAMPLES
========

The file "McastTxRx.pike" is an example of the Multicast Socket
in use. It can send/receive packets to a multicast group.
