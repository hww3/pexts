pdf->begin_page( float width, float height );
	Start a new page in the PDF file. The <width> and <height>
	parameters are the dimensions of the new page in points.
	1pt == 1 inch / 72 == 25.4 mm / 72 == 0.3528 mm

	pdf->begin_page() must always be paired with a matching 
	pdf->end_page() call

pdf->end_page();
	Must be used to finish a page description.

pdf->close();
	Finish the generated PDF document, free all document-related
	resources, and close the output file if the PDF document has
	been been opened with PDF.pdf(filename);. This function
	must be called when the client is done generating pages, regardless
	of the methid used to open the PDF document.
	When the document was generated in memory, the document buffer will
	still be kept after this function called.
	see pdf->generate(); for memory method details.

pdf->generate();
	after a pdf->close() you can have the generated PDF file
	if you  used the memory method (PDF.pdf();)

int pdf->findfont( string fontname, string encoding, int embed )
	Prepare the font <fontname> for later use with pdf->setfont().

pdf->setfont( int font, float size );
	Set the current font int he given fontsize. The font descriptor must
	have been retrieved with pdf->findfont(). The font must be set on
	each page befire drawing any text. Font settings will not be
	retained across pages. The current font can be changed an arbitrary
	number of times per page.

pdf->show( string text, int|void len);
	Print <text> in the current font and font size at the current text
	position. Both font (via pd->setfont();) and current point 
	(via pdf->moveto() or another text output function)
	must have been set before. The current point is moved to the end of
	the printed text.
	An optional <len> argument specifies the maximum length.

pdf->continue_text( string text, int|void len );
	Move to the next line and print <text>. The start of the next line
	is determinated by the leading parameter and the most recent call to
	pdf->show(). The current point is moved to the end of the printed
	text. 
	An optional <len> argument specifies the maximum length.

pdf->set_text_pos( float x, float y );
	Set the current text position to (x,y).

float pdf->stringwidth(	string text, int font, float size );
float pdf->stringwidth(	string text, int len, int font, float size );
	REturn the width of <text> in an arbitrary font and size which 
	has been selected with pdf->findfont(). The width calcualtion tages
	the current values of the following text parameters into account:
	horizontal scaling, character spacing, and wird spacing. 
	An optional <len> argument specifies the maximum length.


pdf->setdash( float b, float w )
	Set the current dash pattern to <b> black and <w> white units. 
	<b> and <w> must be non-negative numbers. In order to produce a solid line, 	set b=w=0. The dash parameter is set to solid at the beginning of 
	each page.

pdf->setlinewidth( float width )
	Set the current line width to <width> units in the user coordinate system. 
	The linewidth parameter is set to the default value of 1 at the 
	beginning of each page.

pdf->moveto( float x, float y )
	Set tge current point to (x,y). The current point is set to the default 
	value undefined at the beginning of each page.
	Note: The current point for graphics output and the current text position 
		are maintained separately.

pdf->lineto( float x, float y )
	Add a straight line from the current point to (x,y) to the current path.
	The current point must be set before using this function. 
	The point (x,y) becomes the new current point.
		The line will be centered around the >>ideal<< line. i.e. half of 
	the linewidth (as determinated by the value of the linewidth parameter)
	will be painted on each side of the line connecting both endpoints.
	The behavior at the endpoints us determined by tge values of the 
	linecap parameter. 

pdf->curveto( float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2, float x3, float y3 )
	Add a Bezier curve from the current point to (x3,y3) to the current path, 
	using (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) as control points. The endpoint of the curve
	becomes the new current point.

pdf->circle( float x, float y, float r )
	Add a curcle with center (x,y) and radius r to the current path. The point
	(x+r,y) becomes the new current point. Elliptical curves can be constructed
	by applying non-uniform scaling factors before drawing the circle.

pdf->arc( float x, float y, float r, float start, float end )
	Add a curcular arc segment with center (x,y) and radius r to the current
	path, extending from start to end degrees. Angles are measured 
	counterclockwie from the positive x axis of the current coordinate system.
	Before drawing the arc segment, this function implicitly moves the 
	current point to the beginning of the arc. The endpoint of the arc
	becomes the new current point.

pdf->rect( float x, float y, float width, float height )
	Add a rectangle with lower left corner (x,y) and the supplied <width> and
	<height> to the current path. Setting the current point is not required 
	before using this function. The point (x,y) becomes the new current point.
	The lines will be centered around the >>ideal<< line, i.e. half of the
	linewidth (as determinated by the value of the linewidth parameter)
	will be painted on each side of the line connecting the respective 
	endpoints.

pdf->stroke()
	Stroke (draw) the current path with the current line width and the current 
	stroke color. This operation clears the path.
